# 👋 Hey, I'm Isaiah Johnson

🎯 I’m passionate about cybersecurity, cloud computing, and building practical tools that solve real problems.

🛠️ Currently working on:
- 🔐 A full SOC lab using Proxmox, Suricata, Zeek, and Wazuh
- 🤖 A smart alert-assistant that auto-researches unknown alerts
- 🏠 A home server running media services and monitoring tools

🎓 I’ve earned my AAS in Cybersecurity and continuing my B.S. in IT Business Management with a focus on incident and risk management.

💡 My mission is to build, break, and secure systems — while always learning and helping others grow in tech.
